When using Linux a popular method of installing software is to make use of a Package Manager, but Package Managers can help
users accomplish a number of tasks. In this post, we'll take a deeper look into Linux Package Managers.

### what are package managers in linux?

In Linux Package Managers are essentially software applications that help users to: Search, Download, Install, Remove 
and Update software applications on their computer operating system. These can be either Command Line tools or a complete
Graphical User Interface application. 

Experienced Linux users will very rarely download software from websites or any other location. The primary reasons for
this included aspects as ease of use, security and the fact that most Linux distributions have a list of sources where 
users can download free open source software packages.

These package sources are referred to as repositories. Using a package manager users will automatically download the appropriate,
package from a configured repository, install it and complete all the required configuration tasks. There is no need to 
for the user to click through a wizard screen or hunt down configuration settings. If packages version are updated within
package repository, the package manager will update each package to its latest version whenever it is requested by the user to do so.

### What is a package?

In Linux a package is a compressed software archive file that contains all the files that comes with a software 
application delivers any kind of functionality, this can be any kind of command line utility,GUI application or a 
software library. 

A package may consist of a binary executable, configuration file and other software  dependencies. Common types of 
Linux packages include `.deb`, `.rpm`, and `.tgz`. Linux packages don't usually contain the dependencies necessary to 
install them, therefore Linux distributions use package managers to automatically read dependencies files and download 
the packages needed before proceeding with the installation.

The package usually includes a manifest of dependencies that must be satisfied for a software application to execute as
expected on any give Linux computer.

Common Package Managers in Linux include:
* dpkg  (Debian Package Manager)
* APT (Advanced Package Tool)
* rpm (RedHat Package Manager)
* yum (Yellowdog Update Modified)
* dnf (Dandified Yum)
* zypper
* flatpak 
* pacman
* snap
* synaptic

Packages also contain scripts that need to be executed if a package is requested to be removed. Ensuring that everything
that is associated with execution of package is cleared up.

### How to use a package manager.

Using a package manager, is typically accomplished via the [terminal window](https://geekiam.io/what-is-a-terminal-window/ "What is a terminal window | Geek.I.Am")
although it is becoming more popular for Package Managers to implement a GUI and most of the popular Linux Distros now provide
User friendly interface to help users install software. These GUI, typically just provide a wrapper and automate the bash commands
used to install using the command line.

For most novice users of Linux, the most common and popular package managers they are likely to first start using is the 
`apt` (Advanced Package Tool) because it is most widely shipped as the default Package Manager for users of Debian, Ubuntu and
Mint.  

We'll cover some of the basic commands of how to use `apt` in order to illustrate the ease of use of using a package manager
in the [terminal window](https://geekiam.io/what-is-a-terminal-window/ "What is a terminal window | Geek.I.Am")

#### How to install a package

You can install a package as follows by specify a single package name or install many packages at once by listing all their names.

To install [Flameshot - a popular free powerful open source screenshot software](https://flameshot.js.org/ "Flameshot - Powerful yet simple to use screenshot software." )

```shell script
sudo apt install flameshot
```
![Flameshot install ](/uploads/apt-flameshot-install.png "Flameshot install")


#### Find dependencies of a package
Once package has been installed you might want to understand which dependencies the package is making use of, you can 
list out the dependencies of a package using apt as follows

```shell script
sudo apt depends flameshot
```
![Flameshot Dependencies ](/uploads/flameshot-dependencies.png "Flameshot dependencies")

#### Search for package

It is highly likely that you will need to search for a package to perform a specific task. The `apt` package manager 
enables you to easily search for packages via the terminal.

In this case, I want to search for an image manipulation program, I can simply include the phrase in quotes and use the
apt search facility

```shell script
sudo apt search "image manipulation program"

```

![apt search ](/uploads/apt-search.png "apt search")
